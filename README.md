## CoinChanger

A program that tells you what will be the smallest possible number of coins that you can get when exchanging a particular number of pence.

### Rules 

- CoinChanger accepts integers from 1 to 99.
- It returns the smallest possible number of coins you're going to get.
- It uses the following coins:
  - 1p;
  - 2p;
  - 5p;
  - 10p;
  - 20p;
  - 50p.

For example: if you pass 81 as an argument, coinChanger will return 4 - (because 81 will be changed into: one 50 pence, one 20 pence, one 10 pence, one 1 pence).
